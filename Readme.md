# Rust cheat sheet

Various rust techniques that are useful to remember so I don't keep implementing them or forget that they're possible.

Also crates so I don't have to keep looking them up.

## Crates

Use [lib.rs](https://lib.rs) for looking up crates. It's just more useful with category rankings and stuff like that. If you're using the [Rust Search Extension](https://rust.extension.sh/) (and you should be), you can change the default search registry from crates.io to lib.rs in its settings.

### Crate Quick Reference

* Codespan-Reporting
* Itertools
* Once-Cell
* Rand
* Regex
* Reqwest, but consider using ureq instead.
* Serde
* Structopt
